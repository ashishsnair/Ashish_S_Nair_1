# Zen Tools UI – Work Hours & Rewards Flow

## Overview

This project showcases the UI design for the **Zen Tools** feature inside Yotube app. The feature encourages users to stay focused during custom work hours by rewarding them with **Zen Credits**, which can be redeemed for perks like **YouTube Premium**.

## Key Features

zen credits are the rewards you earn while completing each of the focus session, there will be two sessions primarily, work hours/study time and bedtime sessions. 
you can set the timing for each session and also select the days
as the session starts it will show up in the homescreen 
once time limit is exceeded it will show up like this, you can choose to continue watching but then no credits will be given, this creates a balance as it doesn’t reduce the engagement but the user the option to not watch it and get rewarded  

## Notes
- The UI is designed to be dark-themed for reduced eye strain and modern appeal.
- The progress system encourages daily usage with clear visual goals.
- Rounded buttons, modern typography, and iconography create an intuitive experience.

## Future Improvements
- Add animations when users complete a session.
- Integrate with other reward options.
- Add notifications for upcoming focus sessions.
